Please use these files with caution, as the paper is still under review.

Data, code or files here may be modified.

A notification will be released when there is a decision on the paper.

Notes about data and code:

1ï¼‰ the main code is run in "fumccm.m", which produces files in the folder of '../fdum/'. This is the main code of the model, which calls ModelCN.m to run simulations from 1971 to 2300 and calculate the utility based on the welfare dynamics.

2)  after running  "fumccm.m", you can run "Organizemonte.m", which execute the post-simulation processing based on the files generated in '../fdum/'. The output of  post-simulation processing are stored in the folder of '../nuclear/'.

3)  after producing the files in '../nuclear/' by running  "Organizemonte.m" , you can run "A1plot_nscc_fig2.m" to produce fig 2a&c in our paper.
